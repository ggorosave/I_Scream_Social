## Description
Social media has become such a prevalent and essential part of modern society. I Scream Social (pun intended) is a backend API for a social media web application built using [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/), [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/), [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), [Day.js](https://day.js.org/docs/en/installation/node-js), and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). While I built this application for practice, it could potentially be paired with a user friendly front end, so users can add friends, share “screams”, and react to each other “screams”.
